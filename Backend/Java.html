    <h1>Java</h1>
    <p>
      Java is a high-level, general-purpose, memory-safe, object-oriented
      programming language. It is intended to let programmers write once, run
      anywhere (WORA),meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms
      that support Java without the need to recompile.Java applications are
      typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine
      (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of
      Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than
      either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as
      reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available
      in traditional compiled languages. Java gained popularity shortly after
      its release, and has been a popular programming language since then.Java
      was the third most popular programming language in 2022 according to
      GitHub.Although still widely popular, there has been a gradual decline in
      use of Java in recent years with other languages using JVM gaining
      popularity.
