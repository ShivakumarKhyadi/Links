    <h1>Spring</h1>
    <p>
      The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control
      container for the Java platform.The framework's core features can be used
      by any Java application, but there are extensions for building web
      applications on top of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform. The
      framework does not impose any specific programming model.[citation
      needed]. The framework has become popular in the Java community as an
      addition to the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) model.The Spring Framework is
      free and open source software.The first version was written by Rod
      Johnson, who released the framework with the publication of his book
      Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and Development in October 2002. The
      framework was first released under the Apache 2.0 license in June 2003.
      The first production release, 1.0, was released in March 2004.The Spring
      1.2.6 framework won a Jolt productivity award and a JAX Innovation Award
      in 2006. Spring 2.0 was released in October 2006, Spring 2.5 in November
      2007, Spring 3.0 in December 2009, Spring 3.1 in December 2011, and Spring
      3.2.5 in November 2013.Spring Framework 4.0 was released in December 2013.
      Notable improvements in Spring 4.0 included support for Java SE (Standard
      Edition) 8, Groovy 2,some aspects of Java EE 7, and WebSocket.
